# Case-Based Reasoning

## Who are we?
We are three German students studying Computer Science at the Berlin School of Economics and Law in a dual system (studying and working for a partnered company). 
## What is our goal?
We aim to establish case-based reasoning as a popular method of solving issues using machine learning. In today's world, artificial intelligence is mostly associated with neural networks. However, other techniques in artificial intelligence, especially in Machine Learning, solve the same issues with fewer resources. <br/>
This goal includes a Python library for developers, a scientific paper for those interested, and a website offering documentation, learning resources, and a roadmap to familiarize oneself with the case-based reasoning technique. We aim to provide anything developers, students, and interested people need to learn the topic.
## What is Case-Based Reasoning?
Generally, case-based reasoning is a technique for solving issues using machine learning. It's highly oriented toward human problem-solving, which is easy for humans to understand.
